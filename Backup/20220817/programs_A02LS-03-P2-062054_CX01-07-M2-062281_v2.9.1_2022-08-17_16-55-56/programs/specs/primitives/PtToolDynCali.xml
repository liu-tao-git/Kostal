        <pt_desc>This primitive is used to calibrate robot tool mass and inertia parameters.
        Now it support three ways to implement the calibration: with wrench sensor(way1), 
        with joint torque(way2) and with joint torque difference with and without tool installed(way3).
        Robot would choose the best way according to configuration and input parameters.
        way1: High Accuracy. Robot is installed with a wrench sensor and tool, "isToolInstalled" set as true
        way2: Low Accuracy. Robot is installed with tool, but NOT enabled in robot config file."isToolInstalled" set as true
        way3: High Accuracy. It need to run calibration two times. 
        For the fist time, Robot IS NOT installed with tool, "isToolInstalled" set as false.
        For the second time, Robot IS installed with tool,"isToolInstalled" set as true. User could also enbale tool
        (with a roughly estimated mass) in robot config file to ensure a better calibration motion performance, if 
        the tool has a large weight.</pt_desc>
